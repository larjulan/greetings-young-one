An antediluvian style salute to all world.

Ahh.. Once again, I feel the smooth touch of the night on my old skin. 
And thirst. It's the second thing I notice, as usual. -smirks-
There's yet a different vibe in the air. This time, I've opened my eyes into a different world, perhaps.
We'll see.. 
-looks at the now-dead-girl in his arms-
These wounds.. It was not I who did this, yet somehow, it led to my resurrection.
I wonder.. Have someone bled this poor soul in here intentionally?
Or was it just the act of fate?
Hmm.. Perhaps it's irrelevant.
The only thing that matters is; I walk on earth again.
-his visage slowly fades into the darkness as incomprehensible whispers are heard-
Let's find out..
-steps out of the sepulcher and disappears into the night-
-a distinct voice is heard just before he disappears though-
"For now, keep it low.." -says to himself- "..and Sarper, please don't forget to act like you are breathing."
